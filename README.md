# DNA
Implement LinkStrand, a linked-list-based DNA model for efficient splicing, following the IDnaStrand interface. Benchmark performance against StringStrand and StringBuilderStrand. Develop an inner Node class for DNA sequence storage, then test LinkStrand using JUnit and compare efficiency with DNABenchmark.
